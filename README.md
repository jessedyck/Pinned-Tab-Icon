# Pinned-Tab-Icon
A WordPress Plugin that adds Customizer controls to select an SVG Image file and set the colour, for use in Safari 9's Pinned Tab feature. See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21462?locale=en_US for details from Apple.

This is a basic plugin that was put together fairly quickly. It does only that one thing, and lets WordPress's Site Identity take care of the rest of the favicons/pinned icons/etc.
