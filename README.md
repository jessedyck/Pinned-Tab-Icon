# Pinned-Tab-Icon
A WordPress Plugin that adds Customizer controls (in the Site Icon section) to select an SVG image file and set the colour, for use in Safari 9's Pinned Tab feature. See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21462?locale=en_US for details from Apple.

This is a very simple plugin. It does only that one thing, and lets WordPress's Site Identity take care of the rest of the favicons/pinned icons/etc.
